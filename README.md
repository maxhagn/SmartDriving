# SmartDriving - Driving Log Application

Smartdriving is the first iOS app I wrote with Swift and Firebase. The goal of the application was to automatically read position data from a car's GPS device and automatically create a driving log for corporate clients. Unfortunately the application could not be used in practice according to Austrian law.
